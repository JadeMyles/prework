\f0\fs24 \cf0 Step 11: Self Care\
\
	I think I\'92ll have the biggest problem with self-care. I tend to enjoy staying up late and eating irregularly. As of late, I\'92ve been working on fixing these issues, but sometimes I can fall right back into them if given the right circumstances. Recently I\'92ve made vows (and kept them) to not take part in any overstimulating activities past 8 with the exception of working. Working will probably be the most invasive life activity to this bootcamp because I need money to survive and will have to work 6-12 nearly every night. Maybe I\'92ll rearrange my work schedule once I\'92m settled into the bootcamp schedule.}
