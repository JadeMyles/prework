    <h2>Bio</h2>

        <p>Straight outta Austin, Texas, this long time music lover is now doing what he always dreampt of: expressing himself via audio. The veteran hip-hop fan is figuring out what it takes not only to make it in the music industry, but to continue to grow as an artist despite the difficulties of making a liveable wage by way of art.</p>
        <p>Destined for greatness is how he describes himself in his own head. Although only having it made it so far in any direction, much less good ones, he trucks on in this ever-changing, fast paced world we call home. "It almost feels as if the rug's been pulled out from under our feet before they even hit the ground," he says while eating his signature low-fat, cookie dough ice cream popsicles. "The world's a tough place to exist in..." he states with conviction, "The life we were shown was within our reach is in the grasp of a small few who seem to have forgotten about the greater good."</p>
        <p>Always on the prowl for the best method of creation, staying reading and keeping up with himself seems to work best according to his most recent interview.</p>
